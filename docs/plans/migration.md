# Migration

## Default Adoption Path

1. Configure GitHub Packages auth as described in [github-packages-setup.md](/home/coder/wave-orchestration/docs/reference/github-packages-setup.md).
2. Install the package with `pnpm add -D @chllming/wave-orchestration`.
3. For a fresh repo, run `pnpm exec wave init`.
4. For a repo that already has Wave config, docs, or waves you want to preserve, run `pnpm exec wave init --adopt-existing`.
5. Edit `wave.config.json` for the repo's docs, roles, validation rules, and executor defaults.
6. Configure Context7 bundles for the external libraries that repo actually uses.
7. Run `pnpm exec wave doctor` and `pnpm exec wave launch --lane main --dry-run --no-dashboard` until validation passes.
8. Upgrade later with `pnpm up @chllming/wave-orchestration` and `pnpm exec wave upgrade`.

## Upgrade Contract

- Package upgrades change the runtime behavior in `node_modules`; they do not copy a new starter scaffold into the repo.
- `wave upgrade` writes `.wave/install-state.json` and `.wave/upgrade-history/*` only.
- Existing `wave.config.json`, role prompts, plan docs, Context7 bundles, and wave files are never overwritten by the upgrade flow.
