# Authoring And Running Waves

This is the shortest path from "I need a new wave" to "the launcher is ready to run it."

Use this guide first. The narrower planner and terminal-surface pages remain useful when you need extra detail, but most operators should not need to assemble the workflow from multiple docs.

## 1. Set Repo Defaults Once

Start by teaching the planner how this repo usually works:

```bash
pnpm exec wave project setup
pnpm exec wave project show --json
```

In a monorepo, run the same setup per project:

```bash
pnpm exec wave project setup --project backend
pnpm exec wave project show --project backend --json
```

The saved project profile remembers:

- default oversight mode
- default terminal surface
- default draft template
- default lane
- typed deploy environments

That keeps later drafts consistent and removes repeated bootstrap questions.

## 2. Draft The Wave

Generate a structured draft:

```bash
pnpm exec wave draft --wave 1 --template implementation
```

For an explicit monorepo project:

```bash
pnpm exec wave draft --project backend --lane main --wave 1 --template implementation
```

The planner writes two artifacts:

- `docs/plans/waves/specs/wave-<n>.json`
- `docs/plans/waves/wave-<n>.md`

The JSON spec is the planner-owned structured artifact. The markdown wave remains a human-reviewable declaration surface, while live execution is driven from the parsed wave definition plus reducer and phase-engine state.

When you review the generated wave, tighten the parts the planner cannot fully infer:

- file ownership
- validation commands
- proof artifacts
- whether the wave needs an optional pre-implementation design steward
- `cont-EVAL` targets when needed
- security review expectations when needed
- explicit `### Skills` only where defaults are not enough
- `signal-hygiene` only when an agent is intentionally long-running and should wait for orchestrator-written signal changes instead of exiting after a one-shot pass

If you want examples of denser hand-authored waves, read [docs/reference/sample-waves.md](../reference/sample-waves.md).

## 2a. Add A Design Steward Only When It Actually Helps

Use the optional `design` role when the wave needs a concrete handoff packet before coding starts, not just more prose.

Good fits:

- architecture-heavy or interface-heavy changes
- multi-owner waves where downstream implementers need the same decisions and assumptions
- ambiguous tasks where open questions should become explicit before code owners fan out

The starter contract in `0.9.1` is:

- import `docs/agents/wave-design-role.md`
- own one packet such as `docs/plans/waves/design/wave-<n>-<agentId>.md`
- keep that agent docs/spec-only by default
- add explicit `### Skills` such as `tui-design` when the packet covers terminal UX, dashboards, or other operator surfaces
- end with `[wave-design] state=<ready-for-implementation|needs-clarification|blocked> decisions=<n> assumptions=<n> open_questions=<n> detail=<short-note>`

When a wave includes one or more design agents, the runtime runs them before code-owning implementation agents. Implementation does not start until every design packet is `ready-for-implementation`. `needs-clarification` and `blocked` behave like normal wave blockers.

If a wave explicitly gives a design steward source-code ownership, that agent becomes a hybrid design steward. The runtime still runs its design pass first, then includes the same agent in the later implementation fan-out with normal proof obligations. Interactive `wave draft` scaffolds the docs-first default; use manual edits or an agentic planner payload when you want the hybrid path.

For long-running non-design agents that should stay alive and react only to feedback or coordination changes, add `signal-hygiene` explicitly in `### Skills`. That skill is not for normal one-shot implementation work.

## 3. Choose The Execution Posture

Every wave should be authored with an explicit operating posture in mind:

- `oversight`
  Best default. Use when a human may need to inspect progress, answer clarifications, or approve risky steps.
- `dark-factory`
  Use only when environments, validation, rollback, and closure evidence are already explicit enough for routine execution without human intervention.

Human feedback is an escalation path, not the operating mode itself. The orchestrator still tries to resolve clarification inside the control-plane and coordination workflow before creating a human ticket.

## 4. Choose The Operator Surface

Live agent runs now execute in detached process runners. The terminal surface only decides how you follow logs and attach to dashboard projections:

- `vscode`
  VS Code gets temporary attach entries for process-backed agent logs and dashboard projections.
- `tmux`
  Terminal-native dashboard and operator projection surface with no VS Code integration.
- `none`
  Dry-run only.

Recommended defaults:

- local interactive work: `vscode`
- remote shell or devbox: `tmux`
- CI or validation-only work: `none` with `--dry-run`

If the surrounding environment is the unstable part, not the repo itself, prefer the sandbox-safe path:

- `wave submit`
- `wave supervise`
- `wave status`
- `wave wait`
- `wave attach`

That is the right fit for LEAPclaw, OpenClaw, Nemoshell, Docker, and similar short-lived exec shells. Use direct `wave launch` when the client shell itself can stay alive for the entire wave. For the concrete setup patterns, read [sandboxed-environments.md](./sandboxed-environments.md).

## 5. Dry-Run Before Live Execution

Treat dry-run as the quality gate for the authored wave:

```bash
pnpm exec wave launch --lane main --start-wave 1 --end-wave 1 --dry-run --no-dashboard
```

Check that the dry-run artifacts reflect the wave you meant to author:

- resolved executors and overlays look correct
- ownership is narrow and explicit
- skills and Context7 inputs are attached where expected
- proof and closure requirements match the actual task
- no ambiguous prompts or missing deliverables remain

## 6. Launch Live

When the dry-run artifacts look correct, launch the wave with the operator surface you actually want:

```bash
pnpm exec wave launch --lane main --start-wave 1 --end-wave 1 --terminal-surface vscode
pnpm exec wave launch --lane main --start-wave 1 --end-wave 1 --terminal-surface tmux --keep-sessions
```

Useful flags:

- `--no-dashboard`
  Skip the dashboard session.
- `--keep-sessions`
  Preserve tmux sessions for inspection after the wave completes.
- `--keep-terminals`
  Preserve temporary VS Code terminal entries.

## 7. Understand Closure

A wave is not done when an implementation agent says it is done. Closure depends on the canonical authority set, typed result state, and the combined runtime projections:

- if present, design packets are complete and `ready-for-implementation` before code-owning work starts
- implementation contracts pass
- required deliverables exist
- proof artifacts exist when the wave requires them
- dependencies and helper assignments are resolved
- `cont-EVAL` satisfies declared targets when present
- security review publishes its report and final marker when present
- integration, docs, and `cont-QA` all pass
