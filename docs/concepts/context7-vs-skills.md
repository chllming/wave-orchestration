# Context7 vs Skills

Context7 and skills solve different problems.

Use Context7 for external library truth. Use skills for repo-owned, reusable operating knowledge.

That comparison matters because Wave treats context as something to compile at runtime, not something humans should maintain separately for Claude, Codex, OpenCode, and every other executor.

## Compiled Context, Not Hand-Maintained Context Files

The active context for an agent is assembled from multiple layers:

- repository source and the wave's owned files
- wave markdown and shared plan docs
- generated shared summary and per-agent inbox
- saved project defaults such as `.wave/project-profile.json` for the implicit default project, or `.wave/projects/<projectId>/project-profile.json` for explicit projects
- resolved repo-owned skills
- selected Context7 snippets for external library truth
- generated runtime overlays and launch artifacts

Because of that, the question is not "which hand-written context file does this runtime use?" The question is "which context sources does this wave compile for the selected runtime right now?"

Runtime-specific context is still real, but it is mostly generated:

- Claude gets merged system-prompt and settings overlays
- Codex gets executor flags plus runtime-projected skills
- OpenCode gets generated config, attachments, and runtime instructions

That keeps the context model unified even when the transport layer differs.

## Short Version

- Context7
  Up-to-date third-party library or API context.
- Skills
  Reusable guidance tailored to your repository, environments, roles, and runtime choices.

## Comparison

| Surface | Context7 | Skills |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary purpose | External docs and SDK truth | Internal reusable operating guidance |
| Typical source | `docs/context7/bundles.json` and fetched snippets | `skills/<skill-id>/skill.json` and `SKILL.md` |
| Ownership | Package or repo operator config | Repository maintainers |
| Scope | Library versions, APIs, setup syntax | Coding rules, deploy norms, repo conventions, workflow rules |
| Selection | Wave defaults plus per-agent `### Context7` | Base plus role, runtime, deploy-kind, and per-agent `### Skills` |
| Change rate | Often changes with external libraries | Changes when your repo or environment changes |
| Projection | Injected as prompt context | Projected into runtime-specific overlays and prompt context |

## When To Use Context7

Use Context7 when the agent needs information that lives outside the repo and can change over time, such as:

- framework APIs
- SDK method signatures
- library setup syntax
- version-specific behavior
- hosted service docs

Context7 is intentionally narrow. It is for third-party truth, not for your repo's own architecture or policies.

## When To Use Skills

Use skills when the guidance is reusable, repo-owned, and should survive across waves, roles, or runtimes, such as:

- coding norms
- review expectations
- environment-specific rules
- Railway, Kubernetes, or GitHub release procedures
- runtime-specific instructions for Codex, Claude, or OpenCode
- role-oriented heuristics for implementation, deploy, cont-QA, or research agents

## What Remains Authoritative

Neither Context7 nor skills replace the actual repo.

The highest-authority sources are still:

- repository source
- `wave.config.json`
- wave markdown
- role prompts in `docs/agents/*.md`
- shared plan docs
- the generated shared summary and inboxes for the active run

Skills are additive guidance. Context7 is non-canonical external context. The repo and wave artifacts remain authoritative.

## How They Work Together

A typical deploy-focused wave might use both:

- Context7
  For the latest official framework or platform docs.
- Skills
  For repo-specific deploy rules, Railway conventions, and runtime-specific execution guidance.

That combination keeps the agent grounded in both external truth and local operating rules.

## Runtime Behavior

Both surfaces are runtime aware, but in different ways:

- Context7 is fetched and injected into the compiled prompt.
- Skills are resolved after executor selection and then projected into the runtime-specific overlay surface for that executor.

Because of that:

- changing Context7 selection changes the prompt fingerprint
- changing resolved skills also changes the prompt fingerprint and trace metadata

## Best Practice

- Put version-sensitive third-party docs into Context7.
- Put stable repo or environment playbooks into skills.
- Keep wave prompts focused on the specific assignment, not long-lived reusable rules.
- If the same guidance is repeated across waves, promote it into a skill.
