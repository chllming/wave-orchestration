# GitHub Packages Setup

Use this package through GitHub Packages under the `@chllming` scope.

GitHub's npm registry still requires authentication for installs from `npm.pkg.github.com`, even when the package and backing repository are public.
This remains the current install path for released versions until the npmjs publish workflow is used for a public npmjs release. If you want to prepare zero-token npmjs publishing for future releases, see [npmjs-trusted-publishing.md](./npmjs-trusted-publishing.md).

## `.npmrc`

Add a repository-local or user-level `.npmrc` entry like this:

```ini
@chllming:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_TOKEN}
always-auth=true
```

`GITHUB_TOKEN` should be a GitHub personal access token or an injected CI token with package read access.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add -D @chllming/wave-orchestration
```

Then initialize the workspace:

```bash
pnpm exec wave init
```

For repositories that already have Wave config, docs, or waves:

```bash
pnpm exec wave init --adopt-existing
```

Then verify the package and starter runtime against the target repo:

```bash
pnpm exec wave doctor
pnpm exec wave launch --lane main --dry-run --no-dashboard
```

## Upgrade

```bash
pnpm up @chllming/wave-orchestration
pnpm exec wave upgrade
```

The package upgrade changes the runtime version. `wave upgrade` writes the upgrade report and changelog files under `.wave/` without overwriting repo-owned plans, waves, or config.
